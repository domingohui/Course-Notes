Goals of test:
1. Find failure
2. Demonstrate correct execution

Deficient fix: when a fix causes previously correct software to misbehave
  - regression testing

Process of testing:
1. Test planning
2. Test case development
3. Running test cases
4. Evaluating test results

Test Cases
 - complete test case includes:
  1. brief statement of prpose
  2. description of preconditions
  3. actual test case inputs
  4. expected outputs
  5. description of expected postcondition
  6. execution history

Identifying test cases
 - functional vs structural
 - specification-based vs code-based
 - black-box testing vs white-box
